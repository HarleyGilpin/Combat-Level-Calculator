## Pixel's NPC Combat Level Calculator for RSPS

### Purpose:
This application aids project collaborators in identifying missing NPC combat level definitions when adding NPCs to RuneScape Private Servers (RSPS).

### Background:
Combat Levels, Equipment stats, and Style bonuses are straightforward to obtain for the Old School RuneScape (OSRS) era, thanks to the Monster Examine magic spell update in 2014. This update displayed critical combat information. However, much of RSPS development focuses on revisions between 503 and 742. In this period, players lacked the tools to gather such combat information, and many were unaware of the shared formulas and mechanics between NPCs and players. Consequently, resources from 2008-2012, including wiki pages, often omitted vital details such as NPC combat levels.

### Why This Tool Is Essential:
After RuneScape's Evolution of Combat update Jagex has made certain data more accessible in its newer versions, the older revisions remain a challenge. This calculator fills that gap, providing an intuitive interface to estimate the combat levels for NPCs, ensuring a more accurate and immersive RSPS experience. Especially for those revisions where combat data was not readily available, this tool becomes a must-have for developers and contributors.
